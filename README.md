# Personal-Website-TechLead.io
It's my portfolio website which showcase my previous works and projects !

Remember that This Website is my portfolio/personal website. Which means that it will contain some Software Engineering projects. !
Though this site is a private repository, I will keep my all Software Engineering projects in public repositories !

And another thing is Using a .io domain can be a good way to identify yourself or your business as part of the Tech scene as you are a TechLead.
You know, Ideas are Cheap, Execution is Everything!!! Keep Remember!
You should buy this domain as soon as possible.
This site will be a SPA (Single Page Application) and Add Free.
